# The Public 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results

## Description

This repository contains the complete, cleaned results of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. To ensure the privacy of respondents, free response submissions and personally identifiable information have been removed. The dataset includes the following files:

1. **survey_results_public.csv**: The main survey results, structured with one respondent per row and one column per answer.
2. **survey_results_schema.csv**: A schema detailing the questions corresponding to each column name in the main results file.
3. **so_survey_2019.pdf**: A PDF of the survey instrument used to collect responses.

The survey was conducted from January 23 to February 14, 2019, with a median completion time of 23.3 minutes for qualified responses. Respondents were primarily recruited through Stack Overflow’s owned channels, including onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, Meta posts, banner ads, and social media. Due to this recruitment method, highly engaged users were more likely to participate.

As an incentive, respondents who completed the survey could opt to receive a "Census" badge.
